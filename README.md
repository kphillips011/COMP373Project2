**Overview**

In this project, we will start providing an object domain model for Facility Management System by addressing the design and implementation using OOP. The aim is to have a domain model that is designed using OOP that will be used to study Object relationship and Dependency.

**Key Objectives**

Based on the specification provided for a Facility Management System:
* Identify the main entities of the problem domain. 
* Identify their attributes. 
* Identify their relationships.
* Identify their roles and responsibilities.
* Discover other objects that facilitate implementing responsibilities. 
* Make available all client interfaces/services specified in the specification document (Facility, Facility Use, and Facility Maintenance Client Interfaces).

**Program Requirements:**
* Facility and its description: This will cover the functionalities such as adding a new facility to be managed, removing a facility from being managed, and getting general information such as the number and capacity of facilities and their current statuses. 
* Facility Use: this covers the functionalities of managing the facility such as reserving a facility, the cost of using and maintaining the facility, and assigning and de-assigning a facility for use.
* Facility Maintenance: this functionality covers the maintenance of a facility such as scheduling a facility for maintenance, checking maintenance status of a facility, listing maintenance requests for the facility, calculating down time of a facility and many more functionalities. 

**Minimum Requirements:**

Functional:
* Create a clear UML Diagram
* Implement interface endpoints in the Project Case Statement
* Distribute Classes/Modules to appropriate layers
* Use Interfaces, Abstract Classes, Modules
* Create Unit testing
* Provide documents to list out your assumptions.

Other Specifications:
* UML Diagram through Draw.io
* Will be created through Java
* GitHub version control
