**Overview**

In this project, we will start providing an object domain model for Facility Management System by addressing the design and implementation using OOP. The aim is to have a domain model that is designed using OOP that will be used to study Object relationship and Dependency.


**Key Objectives**

Based on the specification provided for a Facility Management System:
- Identify the main entities of the problem domain. 
- Identify their attributes. 
- Identify their relationships.
- Identify their roles and responsibilities.
- Discover other objects that facilitate implementing responsibilities. 
- Make available all client interfaces/services specified in the specification document (Facility, Facility Use, and Facility Maintenance Client Interfaces).

**Program Requirements**
- Facility and its description: This will cover the functionalities such as adding a new facility to be managed, removing a facility from being managed, and getting general information such as the number and capacity of facilities and their current statuses. 
- Facility Use: this covers the functionalities of managing the facility such as reserving a facility, the cost of using and maintaining the facility, and assigning and de-assigning a facility for use.
- Facility Maintenance: this functionality covers the maintenance of a facility such as scheduling a facility for maintenance, checking maintenance status, listing maintenance requests, and calculating down time of a facility.

**Minimum Requirements**

Functional:
- Create a clear UML Diagram
- Implement interface endpoints in the Project Case Statement
- Distribute Classes/Modules to appropriate layers
- Use Interfaces, Abstract Classes, Modules
- Create Unit testing

Other specifications:
- UML Diagram created with Draw.io
- Java project language
- GitHub version control system
